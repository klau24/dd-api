There was a mid-year budget cuts and the colleges had to wrestle with that but we took this crisis as an opportunity to enact some real change within the system.",988,1011,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
199,"And, we enacted some common sense reforms, that provided students incentives to go through their programs and graduate. But, they also had to perform. Just a few months ago we adopted a new regulation, over half our students, we have the lowest fees in the nation, and even so, more than half students in the system receive a full ride scholarship.",1011,1031,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
207,"Its called a Board of Governors fee waiver. But, we also felt in order to receive that full ride scholarship, the students need to also invest themselves and perform. So we enacted reform that was not without controversy is that you need to maintain a 2.0 graduation, academic record, in order to quit continue qualify for the full ride scholarship.",1031,1049,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

237,"Were in 2014 right now what would you qualify as the state of our community college system in California today?",1103,1110,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
241,"Well it's much brighter, at first off there's increasing cooperation between the three segments of higher education in California. The Cal States, CSU and, the I mean the Cal States, the UCs, and the community colleges. There seems to be a much greater commitment to community colleges providing access to the to education.",1110,1135,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
251,"And, the thing that we're going to be taking on this year is a, workforce on, a task force on workforce training programs because that's the one unfinished peace from that students success task force that I mentioned. There are some key reforms that can be implemented to enhance workforce programs across the state that partnered with labor, business, and the academic community in order to make sure Californian's have access to the job the training they need to succeed in their careers.",1135,1167,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
265,"That you mentioned, the collaboration of the three branches of higher education in California, obviously community colleges you're K through 12, or K through 14 in this case, where  Prop 98 dollars are the vast majority dollars.",1167,1180,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
271,"The UC system as well as the Cal State system have historically been separate entities, separate satellites and there has, it's sort of been a history where there has been very limited collaboration, cooperation and now something  brilliant just happened the left-hand start speaking to the right-hand, and the right-hand starts being the left-hand and all of the sudden folks sort of broke down the walls,",1180,1209,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
283,"the barriers, the silos and start communicating with each other so in a little bit you know-how that came about and why it took so long to where we could have the three branches of government happen, instead of having vertical integration you had a very balkanized silo'd.",1209,1224,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
291,"This is my territory here, and we're not working in concert with each other and then I want a few your thoughts because, obviously not everyone's on the track for a four year university and that's okay because I think what we've done is we've created mindset, this environment that lets you off to UC school, Cal State school, or private independent college then you're not a success.",1224,1249,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

315,"So, give us a few thoughts obviously on the Cal State integration in terms of communication with community colleges thats separate from that from the four-year degrees concept, you know, the backbone of economic growth and the role that you envision the community colleges playing.",1272,1290,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
323,"Well I'll address the first one, first. Candidly what provided a framework to make this happen was political leadership and a lot of that leadership came from the California State Senate. For example, Senator Padilla's bill Senate bill 1440, mandated that the community colleges and the Cal State system need to align their programs together.",1290,1309,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
333,"So for whatever resistance might have been there in the past, the legislature provided powerful incentive to both systems to align their curriculum so that the student graduating with a degree in psychology from Pasadena City College where I served on the board can then enroll, and have the choice in a spot at a Cal State system automatically junior status, and not have to go shopping for the right type of match for their articulation for their programs.",1309,1338,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

347,"It's unprecedented when our Chancelor Brice Harris came on the scene just over two years ago, and then Tim White became head of the Cal State system, and Janet Napolitano, they both, they all took it with the encouragement of their boards as an opportunity to find ways to partner in interact.",1346,1365,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
355,"Part of it was political leadership from the legislature, but it's also the personal leadership and commitment exhibited by the leaders of the system that began from day one working together to find ways to align the systems to the benefit of the students.",1365,1382,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
361,"I agree a 100% is with what you're saying my professional career has been with four-year institutions and research universities, I work at USC.",1382,1390,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
365,"But, a USC degree while fabulous, is not the answer for every student graduating from high school in California. There are tremendous opportunities in the workforce area, that may not even the two years of education might just needed a year specialized training that the community colleges are very well position to provide.",1390,1414,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
375,"In so, that's why we're doing this work force taskforce. We're going to have multilateral participation from faculty, from labor, from business, from the legislature, and others to identify those programs that where there's really there are strong job skills needed and how can we design and deliver programs in a cost-effective way to those students .",1414,1439,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

403,"I think it's going to be very critical. Obviously it's going to add to our continued economic growth and I think that the community colleges and the vision that is laid out especially for the kids who will not be attending a four-year university they're going to be critical to the continued economic growth of California.",1488,1505,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

525,"Thank you very much Ms. Fuller. Mr Baum, I have another question. This is something that you can educate us, you can educate me, why is that some community colleges have a stellar reputation for college transfers?",1792,1808,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
533,"And, others have perhaps not as robust reputation? Is that more a question of what that campus tends to focus on more so than others? Is it a robust PR campaign? Is it extra counselors who are really, you know, just honed down in focusing transfer rates?",1808,1830,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

581,"And, its going to be much harder for those students to transfer to the four-year university until they're brought  up to the basic skills of doing college-level math and English. The other track that we can't let institutions overlook is the career path, the workforce training.",1910,1928,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

1611,"The board is engaged in developing a system for monitoring the treatments, and making sure that the objectives are met because it is a pilot that will end in several years so I think that because it's a pilot will get a chance to see whether the economics of doing those types of timber sales are better and more that type of work is done and will also be able to assure that these treatments actually do reduce fire hazard so that we have a better chance of controlling wild fire in the state.",352,390,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
1625,"Thank you, so, Richard, how do you think we should manage burn lands as we've had very severed and large fires in recent years, especially in my area, what is your view of trees salvage operations in these areas?",390,407,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
1631,"I am in favor of salvaging timber not only to recover the timber, but also to reduce future fire issues, the more, the more fuel to leave on the ground, the more propensity there is for the for there to be a future far that's very intensively burn that so, you know, if you get in that pattern of fires repeating themselves and you're going to have some pretty severe site degradation, overtime you can actually reduce the productivity of that land overtime, so I think it's important to be able to reduce that fire danger from might be able to salvage which timber and reducing the future of fire intensity.",407,457,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
1653,"Also, I'm a strong advocate for recovery value and the timber has value so it is an economic driver both terms of rural jobs and maintaining the infrastructure of the forest products industry which is an important consideration now. We don't, the infrastructure has been shrinking over time so our ability to undertake fuel reduction projects over the state is actually diminished somewhat by the lack of people are actually knowledgeable in capable of doing that type of work.",457,493,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

1683,"The, we will get a recommend, a recommendation from the from cal fire based on how based of changed hands, and also on, they're, they're basically their GIS analysis. I don't, based on that there haven't been any major changes except the swapping between the forest service and CalFair, on direct protection area so I don't anticipate there's going to be any major changes in the SRA boundaries, although in the actual numbers, but there may be some differences in how direct protection area is allocated between agencies in the state. like",537,590,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
1709,"I'd like to respond to that as well. The basic criteria for determining state possibility areas is depended on the resources that can be derived from those lands, so the three primary categories are whether it's timberland, whether it yields water supplies for the public or whether it's for each land and so. Given those criteria if during the yes right identification process, if those are still seemed being viable uses for the land and therefore of interest to the state in terms of protecting it, that's the basis for having the SRA, is that the state sees fit to protect those resources on behalf of the people of the state, and so unless you have development to such a degree that those types of resources you're not going to be yielding from that particular acre or parcel, then it will  remain as SRA so other than the type of encouragement of the life urban interface where we have pretty high-density developments that have been encouraged into those types of lands.",590,662,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

1753,"Obviously, were drought conditions. We had a fantastic rainy period for the last few weeks throughout the city in California, not just in northern California but in southern California as well, but we still do remain in drought conditions. I know this year alone in twenty fourteen we've had over a thousand wild fires more than the average in the last five years, so last year, twenty thirteen, we obviously had the ring fire, which had a burn area the size of Oakland and San Francisco as well as San Jose combine, put together, so through your views, both of you, your perspective, what are the obstacles that we face, California that, to deal obviously with the increase number of wildfire hazards that we're facing because of drought conditions?",686,741,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
1775,"I had an opportunity earlier this year, actually in the fall of this year, to go to Lake Tahoe into the forest with Senator Teddy Gaines of his invitation to see, because he is a geographical senator for Lake Tahoe area and to learn a little more about timber, harvesting and I will admit it was enlightening, it was education for me to get that perspective and actually learn something that I had limited or actually that's to luxurious of a definition. I had no knowledge whatsoever on timber harvesting to go up there, and learn the pros and cons, and obviously speak with environmentalists, but also speak with folks who encourage timber harvesting and to why the conditions that word right now, what should be your thoughts, share with us, what the obstacles we face as a state, as we have increased wild fires, our hazards in California?",741,805,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

I think, I think it's just, just sheer scope of the problem that we have millions of acres of wild land where we have allowed conditions to become over stock or well, to the degree where there's too much vegetation that carries fire too easily. So part of the problem is the sheer magnitude of it.",805,830,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
1811,"Secondly, there are elements to some of the methods that you might use to treat it. That would be prescribed burning so, you know, one way to reduce fuels is to use prescribe burning and that would be through the agencies to help to devise a strategy to reduce our fuels over certain areas that are strategic. You have air quality constraints that definitely constrain your ability to do those prescribe burns.",830,866,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
1827,"And, I'll just leave it to Susan to respond as well as. It's just the cost of doing it is high, and so if you're doing prescribed burning? Or if you're doing some kind of mechanical treatment so you're using some kind of machinery to help to reduce fuels by clearing brush say, for example, it's very expensive and that gets back a little bit to the conversation we're having with Senator Cannella about harvest plants and that the whole processes such that everything's a little, more expensive to do therefore the projects aren't as attainable economically by a land owner, so rely more on grants.",866,914,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

The time, the amount of time fires can burn during the day and the length of the fire season is ... noticeably longer, field moisture are much lower so there's much more stuff available. It's not for a lash of scale or resources from the firefighting community. We've  got more sophisticated but it's just basically that fires are much more difficult to put out, there's more spotting where the fires spot ahead of themselves and that's a combination of conditions, but also fuel availability as Rich said, it's pretty daunting for the firefighters, and I know the firefighters in California really appreciate the support, your support, and understanding of the difficulty and the dangerous aspects of their job.",1100,1155,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

You're very strict, prescriptive requirements about how much, how many trees are left, how big trees are left. The notion, that should be examined to allow for the maximum amount of flexibility within the constraints of protecting all the other resources, environmental resources, but trying to actually modify the landscape over the long term to make it more fire resilient, so we try to reduce some of these very fixed stance that carry fire so easily and that's going to be a long-term process that forester land managers will have to undertake, both public and private, so it is both.",1546,1613,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

A couple questions I want to start off with. Obviously, in 2001 and 2008, you know, CalSTRS took some very sustained heavy losses. Obviously, we've had some different dynamics now, a new measure by Bonta that has been moved forward and codified into law. Obviously, the dynamic right now with CalSTRS is the liabilities approximate, you would know the number more precisely I think, about $73/$74/$75 billion dollars in unfunded liabilities. The paradigm has been shifted with regards to the role and responsibility fiscally. That being, how much is going to fall on the shoulders of school districts, as well as community colleges, on the individual teachers, as well as the State of California. I think it's a 70:10/20 ratio respectively with regards to teachers, the state itself at 20% school districts and community college districts. It's a completely different dynamic now.

The fact that everyone including the stakeholders, you know, the state, the teachers, and the school districts were able to come together and work out a solution that shares responsibility I think is really important.",423,464,Author,Indeterminate,CA

The the contributions for those three different stakeholders as you mentioned will increase, but will increase over a phased in period, you know, a longer phase in period I think for the school districts over 7 years, given that there is a greater contribution increase that they will see. I think that when, you know, the legislature and the governor took that approach it was, you know, really in order to try to manage the impact, you know, of those contribution increases to those stakeholders, you know, over a period of time.  You know, in terms of how this will play out, you know, we are I think one of the - well this is a huge accomplishment. You know, so much of what the board is focused on is how do we manage risks in our portfolio to make sure that, you know, we're doing our best to meet or exceed that 7.5% rate of return that's in the funding plan. Whether it's through reports to the legislature that I think are required by the bill or just the annual valuations and analyses that we do at the CalSTRS board on an annual basis, you know, there will be a lot of transparency in terms of how the funding plan is proceeding and what progress it's making toward, you know, toward its final goal 30 years later.",464,550,Author,Indeterminate,CA

7052,"This is not for you, but I just have to say Mr. President, and really to the governor's office, that as I think about the composition of our teaching core and therefore the retiree population of teachers I am struck by the relative lack of ethnic diversity on the CalSTRS boards. I hope that we're able to have a conversation with the governor to talk about making sure that this board is a true and much more accurate representation of the teaching core that they represent. I think that's important. One quick question. We had an opportunity to have dialogue today, but I'm curious really about your opinion. Recognizing that the state doesn't employ teachers directly, what do you believe is the appropriate state role in setting and funding teacher retirement benefits? That's a conversation we've had in the legislature over these last couple years as we talked about the future.",573,636,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

I mean I think that the state plays, you know, an appropriate role, you know, in doing that, in terms of establishing both the benefits as well as, you know, working with the legislature and making sure that the levels of the contributions, you know, are ones that are appropriate and set in that way.",636,659,Author,Indeterminate,CA
7088,"And so what responsibility should the state have in funding it? I think that's been the issue in terms of the teachers contributing to their fund versus what the state has to put into the fund.

7096,"Yeah, and, I think that the, you know, through the passage of the legislation last year was an indication that the state, you know, does believe that it has a responsibility to meet the funding obligations for the teacher's retirement benefits.

7118,"A couple of things that I've learned; One is that you know, while there is you know, often appropriately a lot of focus on CalSTRS and its role as an investor and as a thought leader on financial and investment in corporate governance initiatives, those are all really important and critical, but you know, one of the things that I think is not as well-known or highly touted are the things that CalSTRS has done and is doing to really be responsive to its members. There are annual customer surveys that they do - customer service surveys that they do, there has been so much that the system has done through the boards leadership in terms of, you know, expanding new customer service centers around the state to give teachers an opportunity to be able to, you know, drop in if they have questions about their retirement. They've looked for ways to expand, you know, how we communicate to our teachers. If you think about the spectrum of members that we have, there might be some teachers who, you know, wanted to see things on a piece of paper. There might be other teachers who don't even want to talk to a live human being and want to be able to go to the computer and get all the information that way. I think CalSTRS has done a great job trying to be responsive in that way, and I think it's an area - I have the privilege of serving on and actually being the vice chair of the benefits committee this year, and I think it's one of the areas that I want to continue to pursue, along with contributing to the discussions that we have about our investment future and sustainability issues.",728,828,Author,Indeterminate,CA

I think it's a culture that's a really positive one and that has allowed us to be as, you know, make as much progress as we have over the last several years, both internally with how the fund works as well as being able to try to influence the dialogue externally.",854,902,Author,Indeterminate,CA

I know that obviously it is not - you have no decision authority making nor does the current stuff at CalSTRS, but to the powers that be, obviously. You are a person of color, which adds to the diversity of this board, but it is duly noted the dearth and I don't think folks promote diversity for the sake of diversity, per say, but knowing that, you know, with a sense of intentionality, you have to go out there and you have to seek folks because on the natural it doesn't happen, you know.

Defined benefit pensions have been under attack for a number of years. I would just ask you to be ever vigilant and make sure that they continue to be funded, the CalSTRS plan continues to be funded. As you know better than I, most of the recipients of those pensions are women and it is hard enough to find a good job, let alone a good job that provides a pension, and I think that women suffer in that area even more than men. We talked a little bit about this yesterday. I think you have a very good knowledge of the pension plans and we talked a little bit about funding and how that will work, but I would just ask you to please be ever vigilant. We still hear that pension reform is needed and a lot of times we hear that the pensions that folks want to reform are people who don't receive a large pension, and these teachers don't receive large bloated pensions. I would just ask you to please be ever vigilant in that area. Thank you.",1031,1102,Discussion,For,CA

We've been very appreciative of the fact that she has been very engaged with the constituent groups and willing to listen especially through many of the complex issues.

What concerns me is that it's an issue we continue to hear in this legislative body and I'm very sorry I wasn't here, but I hope that either in the context of the confirmation for the director, the new director, in the budget discussion, in some context that we as a legislature can hear a report from the department about the allegations that have been very public.

7775,"This is something that may accelerate as the as the climate warms.  But, what that does is it increases the likelihood of storm surges and it basically makes it more likely to have bigger, bigger flooding in coastal areas so this is a concern along the ocean coastline in the Bay Area and, in the Delta.",1055,1075,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7785,"It's also likely that according to climate models that we're going to be having more extreme weather. So more extreme droughts more extreme floods and warming temperatures also mean that we get less snow and more rain and that can increase the effect of individual big storms in the winter and make it more likely to flood.",1075,1094,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7793,"So those are just a couple things to kind of keep in mind thinking about how we plan for our flood infrastructure. Now the video did a great job of showing for the Central Valley the complexity of our flood management system and this just lists a few of the different kinds of pieces of infrastructure there.",1094,1113,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7801,"And, I just wanted to add one thing and this is something that has been consider a lot in the context of Central Valley flood planning is the fact that some kinds of approaches can in addition to improving flood protection can yield some other benefits.",1113,1129,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7809,"As I'm showing you here a picture of the Yolo bypass, just as one example of that. This was something that was, has been around since the early twentieth century. It's critical to the protection of the Sacramento metro area from flooding.",1129,1140,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7815,"It turns out that it's also great from an ecosystem perspective and it provides a lot of benefits in that way we're discovering that in addition to helping with birds it's is actually a great place to raise baby salmon.",1140,1153,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7821,"Some of these kinds of bypasses can also be useful for helping to recharge the ground water basins. So, something that more and more folks are keeping in mind, also thinking about levees, set back levees, instead of building them very close to the edge of the river building them back a bit gives a bit more room for the river which can increase the flood protection for the folks behind those levees but it also can enhance the other benefits.",1153,1179,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7831,"So we face a lot of challenges in managing floods, there's a big investment gap. I am going to show you that in a minute. So, we also in the Central Valley the State is liable potentially for a billions of dollars in damages.",1179,1193,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7837,"And, this stems from a court ruling in 2003 called the Paterno Ruling, which held the State liable for the failure of a locally manage levy within the Central Valley and that relates to the nature of the complex nature of the state-federal role in Central Valley flood protection.",1193,1213,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7845,"In particular which I think was probably one of the factors that really got folks mobilized after Hurricane Katrina to get some get some flood money into a bond on a ballot and asked voters to approve it.",1213,1227,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7851,"Now the second point, the point there about flood control investments helping and not eliminating risk is what I what I already mentioned to you. That's especially an issue in places where we are building according to federal standards. Which basically Federal Flood Insurance Standards require communities to restrict construction in places with less than  protection from a 100- year flood.",1227,1248,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7861,"There are only about four percent of the population that lives in those areas that are very flood prone. But then if you have protection from that 100-year flood, which is a flood that's large enough that it has a 1% chance of occurring every year if you got better protection and that thanks to levee for example, then there are no restrictions, or at least under federal under the federal",1248,1273,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7871,"Now California has changed that recently for Central Valley urban areas and I'll come back to that at the end of my talk. But just to say, you know, if you've got that kind of a protection most experts think that's not enough for an urban area and if you're still building in those places and if you levy fails you've got you've got more damage than if you had less fewer folks there.",1273,1295,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7881,"And this photo I think is interesting because, it's the San Joaquin River near Stockton and this is exactly the kind of place where you know, there is a high flood risk, a lot of folks living and with the Paterno Ruling the State is definitely on the hook for damages in this in this place.",1295,1314,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7889,"The fact that we can't eliminate flood risk means that we need to complement investments with other tools like insurance and there is Federal Flood Insurance available, it's can be quite expensive in the 100-year flood plain.",1314,1328,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7895,"In the areas that are protected by the for at least that amount of protection at least a 100-year protection it's actually not that expensive. But people don't tend to use it that much they kind of feel like okay I'm off the hook they don't have to use it and some of the recent data that DWR shared with me on flood insurance suggests, that it looks like flood insurance uptake is down in California, probably because it's been dry, probably because of the recession so on.",1328,1353,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7905,"So even in a 100-year flood plain where folks are really, really should have that insurance it looks to us like it's maybe 22% of the people living in that area have it right now.",1353,1367,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7911,"So, just now switch over a little bit to the money side and the investment gap. We did a study that came out in March last year, looking at water finance for the water system as a whole and this is a slide that just kind of gives you a big-picture overview of what we're spending, who's spending money on water, California's water system, local governments, state governments, federal governments, and how much in the different sectors.",1367,1394,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7923,"And, you can see that flood management is not the big ticket item in the overall scheme of things. The big-ticket items are specially urban water supply and urban wastewater systems, which are vast underground systems, miles and miles and miles of a plumbing and treatment facilities so on.",1394,1413,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7931,"So, a little bit less than $2.2 billion annually on flood management, a big chunk of that by locals, locals cover most maintenance, and they cover about half of the investment and then the state and federal governments come in with money mostly to help with the investments.",1413,1431,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7939,"And, just to give you those numbers for that for that period 08-2011 the federal government is providing us with about $250 million a year, the state was putting in about $575 million and locals about $1.325 billion total. So locals are raising some money for this even though they're getting, they're really relying importantly on federal and especially increasingly state help.",1431,1459,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7951,"You're looking at the GO bonds that in particular Prop. 1e in November 2006 voters approved both Prop 1e, which I think was about $4.1 billion and then there was also some funding for floods in Prop 84 which was also on that ballot.",1459,1480,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7959,"So total we're looking at a bit less than $5 billion that was made available.  This is new for California, California was not used to using GO bonds for this purpose and I think this really came out in recognition of the fact that there was a big investment gap and that the expectation of federal cost shares.",1480,1499,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7967,"The federal policy is to, for any project that's authorized by, and has a Chief's report and you probably hear more about that from subsequent speakers. Local agencies are eligible for quite a large cost-share up to 65% in some cases, but the Federal Government just has not had the kind of funds available to fund all the projects that would in principle qualify for that.",1499,1522,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7979,"So, that's led to a kind of a long, long waiting list  of projects so, the State has really stepped in to help to help fund there. As you mention Mr. Chair, the Governor now proposes in the administration's budget to spend the remaining funds from prop 1e, $1.1 billion.",1522,1544,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7987,"That'll be a big jump compared to the typical annual state spending. That's going to be really welcome but, then when that's gone, look what's in Prop 1 that just passed, not a whole lot. So, would not to diminish the value of every dollar that's there but, clearly this is not, this is going to be on the agenda soon again, I think, in terms of finding state funds to bring in State's share.",1544,1572,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
7999,"This just shows you kind of where the bonds bond funds have gone since 2006 for flood management, a range of different kinds of things, especially levees, this is mostly in the Central Valley. That was the focus of Prop 1e in particular.",1572,1592,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8005,"And, then here's the flood gap, the flood investment gap. So the DWR Army Corp Report estimated that California had a flood investment need of at least $50 billion. We looked at that and, took out some of the funding in the Delta and replaced it with some different numbers, because that included sort of thinking about flood protection for water supply including, including the Peripheral Canal or tunnels.",1592,1618,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8017,"So when you instead just put in money for shoring up Delta levees and not thinking about the Water Supply Project that gets you to about $34 billion. Now if we figure that it's reasonable to try to get that spent in 25 years if we really want to address our flood risk and, that gives us about $1.4 a year that we should be spending on investments not counting maintenance investments.",1618,1644,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8029,"And, that's the orange bar there, the dark blue bar is what we have been spending about $600 million annually in investments. So, we have to more than double that basically and you can see that the share a chunk of that is from bond funds that are almost gone.",1644,1662,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8037,"So, the near term bond funds will help, but then we're going to have this ongoing and federal, federal funds are lagging or we won't be increasing for sure in the current federal budget environment, and locals face a lot of challenges in raising these funds. Some local agencies have been successful, but they have to go to voters now since 1996.",1662,1683,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

8051,"So, I just want to show you the kind of comparison by region. This is the busy slide, but it's basically to say if, kind of compare, what happens. How do we fill this gap if we use state bond funds or if we use local funds and everybody in the local region, everybody in the county pays.",1695,1714,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8061,"Basically California has to about double the amount of spending that we're doing at a local level in order to fill this investment gap, about $30 per person state-wide. If we do it with general obligation bonds, that's the brown line, so, what we're spending now is green, the brown line is the bar is what we would cost per region, per person, annually to fill the gap with general obligation bonds.",1714,1741,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8073,"And, then the orange is what it would cost if it if it's has to be spent locally, and you can see that for the Central Valley both for the Sacramento River in the San Joaquin river regions the orange bar is way, way bigger.",1741,1751,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8077,"And, that's because there's a very high flood risk here. A lot of, a big investment gap, not as many people, and the way that we fund general obligation bonds is through the state general tax, general taxes and those are heavily skewed toward income tax the higher incomes in the Bay Area and in the South Coast so you can see that the Bay Area's brown bar is bigger that way.",1751,1774,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8087,"It's just something to consider in terms of what's the ability to pay in different areas and, what's the appropriate mix of funding. So, I'm just going to end with a few thoughts on policy priorities.",1774,1790,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8097,"I think that the legislature in 2007 took some really important steps with a flood package that for the Central Valley that raised urban protection standards to 200-year flood, so doubling the federal protection level, new planning tools, the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan, CVFPP, is a testament to that really looking at a very sophisticated way, at a lot of these issues ecosystem objectives, are being incorporated in very creative ways.",1790,1818,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
8105,"We think that the state should consider extending these reforms to other regions. As you saw in that first graph with the maps, there are big risks elsewhere in the state as well.

I notice that you, and I know this happens a lot that we talk about the floods and we start basically from the dams down, because once the dams get filled up then they have to release the water when we have an event. But there's a giant watershed above those dams that has the ability to retain water and the timing of that water coming to those dams. And,we've had a large increase in fire.",5,36,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8149,"And, we had just in my district last year, we burned over three hundred-thousand acres, which will take a long time for it to have vegetation back on there, to stabilize those meadows and those forested areas. So hass there been any talk about how we take a look at the watersheds above the dams and try to figure out how to re-water those meadows and open that forest up and get it fire resilient, so the fire doesn't you know, take out huge landscapes and release water in more rapid time. So has there been any ... you know?",36,78,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8167,"That's a really great question and I think that's precisely one of these kind of multi-benefit approaches that one can bring to bear, because work that's been done, especially at UC Merced. I think folks at UC Berkeley are also looking at this. You can buy with good forest management in upper watersheds, there's a potential to improve water supply benefits to be helping on the flood side ...and also to be helping with water quality.",78,106,Testimony,For,CA

8185,"Thank you very much. In terms of becoming more familiar with how the relationships are between government and private property. For instance, when I saw the Yolo bypass. Can you help me, familiarize me with that bypass area. Would that be private ownership with certain rights to be able to flood the land when it's needed to bypass for the Sacramento River? And is that similar or different in different parts of the state?",123,153,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8199,"So, the Yolo bypass, that's mostly privately-owned land and the folks there, way back in the day, were given some funds to basically have a flood easement.

It's still your property, but that's a condition on your property.",153,179,Testimony,For,CA
8209,"I think that, you know, some of the discussions more recently about expanding, that kind of an approach elsewhere. The local governments have expressed concern about how one would make additional payments for new kinds of easements or conditions on lands and thinking about instead of just a one shot deal, maybe you want to think about, you know, some sort of ongoing payments.  In particular, not just to the landowners, but maybe also thinking about if you're reducing the possibility of construction in some of these areas, local governments don't want necessarily forgo the potential revenues that would be coming from that.",179,223,Testimony,For,CA
8229,"And I think that the Sacramento area flood control agency has been doing some really creative work with some farmers and the county in Yolo on this kind of approach, in thinking about, you know, places that, where it's better not to build up flood protection in order to provide more general protection for the urban areas, but then with some financial compensation for that.",223,244,Testimony,For,CA

8277,"The second one, and something for all of California, but particularly for people that we saw in some of the photos, Stockon, for example. You talked about the lack of enrollment in flood insurance and how this occurs during drought and yet, history informs us that flood follows drought.

We do some work with them, it's a nonpartisan think tank on environmental issues and they are looking at the possibility of community-based insurance. So maybe, you know, thinking instead of relying on each individual getting their own policy, finding ways for communities to pool resources and do that.

There's a concern of under seepage through sandy materials under the levee. Sacramento is the most at risk metropolitan area for flooding.  It is going, just look at the water raging. That is heading towards homes. Across the nation man-made mounds of dirt or concrete, commonly called levees,  surround waterways, farmland and cities, helping control the flow of water and reduce the risk of flooding for millions of people.",443,483,Discussion,Neutral,CA

Levees are an extremely important part of the regions' flood risk reduction system. But like all infrastructure, without continual inspection and maintenance, they're guaranteed to fail. There are four primary reasons why levees fail. They include seepage, stability, erosion and height. A seepage levee failure involves water literally sleeping through the levee or the levee foundation. A stability failure involves a section of levee sluffing off because of water up against the levee.",483,522,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8355,"Film 'How Levees Fail When we Fix Them': There are numerous types of erosion failures, but what's prevalent on the Sacramento River flood control system is toe erosion steepening the slope, such that it's unstable to the point of collapse and inundation. And then there's levee height, when you get more flow than what they're designed for, often times leads to a levee failure because of water spilling over the top of the levee. Many California levees were constructed more than a hundred years ago, often by non-engineers simply piling up dirt along the riverbank or around an area of land to stop floodwaters. As more and more people move into the flood plains behind those levees, the risk of catastrophic flooding continues to increase. Over time, without proper maintenance and improvements, and because of impacts from weather, animals, and unauthorized development, these levees became weaker and weaker.",522,564,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8375,"Film 'How Levees Fail When we Fix Them': So what do we do to fix levees, to deal with those various problems. For seepage, a common fix is building a seepage cutoff wall. A seepage cut-off wall is constructed by digging a deep trench into the middle of the levee and filling the gap with an almost water-tight wall of clayer concrete. The cut off wall can only be constructed to about a hundred twenty feet deep, and if you're not able to tie into an impermeable layer at that depth, then we have to use a different method. What's frequently used is the seepage berm. The intent is to extend the seepage path long enough, so that the velocity of the water that's coming out is so reduced that it doesn't weaken the levee and the levee foundation.",564,614,Discussion,Neutral,CA
8401,"Film 'How Levees Fail When we Fix Them': Stability is dealt with by widening a levee and flattening slopes. Erosion is dealt with by building a layer of rock to strengthen the levee and its foundation. For height deficiencies, we construct higher or build a flood wall. Even after levees are improved, there will always be risk. That's why continual inspection and maintenance is required.

If you want to build something over it, if you want to affect it, go under it, you need to come to the board and we in turn, work with the army corps of engineers to get a letter permission from them so that you know, that whatever you're putting on the levees, around the levees is going to be safe and in accordance with standards. That's how we maintain the integrity of the existing system.",844,878,Testimony,For,CA

After the plan was adopted in June of 2012 and the adoption of that was actually the board holding a lot of public workshops, getting a lot of venue for folks who were interested in giving their opinion about the plan. We had been working for two years on implementing the plan.",989,1021,Testimony,For,CA
8577,"So concurrently, while DWR and I'm sure they'll tell you a little bit more about the update of the plan that's coming, the 2012 plan is being implemented and some of what's going on with that, our core board sponsored projects. So, the board operates as the non federal or the state partner on some of these very large projects that you're going to hear about from the core that are going on: dam raises, the west sac in Sacramento, they call it American river common features, there's some really big projects that are going on, so we also are the liaison for that.",1021,1058,Testimony,For,CA
8591,"And most importantly, there's a new focus, sort of a sustained and renewed focus on what we call multi benefit projects. The large massive flood ways that you saw are wet not very often, so when they aren't, they're being used for other things. And managing what those other things are and how they can fit into habitat and recreation and while still maintaining their primary purpose, which was flood control has really been a challenge for all of us. So as we continue to work on that, we're going to be very busy in the years to come and hopefully, we'll be able to come back before the board and report on future progress.",1058,1094,Testimony,For,CA

8609,"Hello, I'm Melinda Terry. I'm the executive director of the California Central Valley Flood Control Association, which was established in 1926 to promote the common interests of flood management in the central valley. Our membership includes over seventy members that are either reclamation levee districts or cities and counties that also have flood control responsibilities. And although the state planned flood control system facilities are from Red Bluff down to Fresno, our membership is concentrated really between maybe Chico and Tracy, so we don't have members in the whole entire system, but everywhere in between, including the delta.",1100,1136,Testimony,For,CA
8625,"And, to just give you a little idea, to try to even breakdown for the locals because there's a difference in those. A common reference that you'll hear particularly from the army core, but the board often refers to my members as the LMA's. Those are local maintaining agencies. So those are typically the reclamation or levee districts that I talked about and they're the ones that literally, and I see mine every morning when I leave for work, that they drive and patrol our levee system. I live in west Sacramento, but they do that every single day. So, they're doing a daily routine maintenance of the state's flood control system.",1136,1178,Testimony,For,CA
8643,"But, they also then help the board and the state by when there's improvements that need to be done, they go ahead and take control of doing the design, planning, and going through the permitting process for the state. Those districts are then governed by elected trustees, who are landowners within that leveed system. Then you have the cities and counties. They, of course, in addition to having some flood control responsibilities in areas that they control, they also are key when it comes to flood. If you think about Ellen, when she was talking about because they're the ones that are doing the land use and deciding how many people and buildings and assets, if you will, are living behind those levees. So, they're a part of that.",1178,1216,Testimony,For,CA
8659,"They also have emergency response capabilities and I forgot to mention that the parties are typically the first responders in a flood fight. They're there with your equipment and fighting. Almost immediately, they have to turn it over the state and federal government to take over, but they're the first responders.",1216,1232,Testimony,For,CA
8667,"Then lately, over the last couple decades, we have what are called joint power agreements, where the urban areas, so in our system I'll get to in a second, have created, joined together where they'll get some of the RD's in the cities and counties and they'll join forces, so they can do these larger civil works projects. So, those are ongoing and I'll talk about those in a second. The local issues are quite complex and they've really been changing over the recent years because we have a lot of conflicts like, you know, you have to prioritize public safety, but we're also constantly chasing federal eligibility for reimbursement money, and that's meeting certain levee standards and to meet those standards is expensive.",1232,1276,Testimony,For,CA
8685,"Our members have to balance land owner expectations for flood protection versus the state assurances that they've given to the federal government and what we need to do for the state, you know. So, we've got multiple bosses kind of doing this tug-of-war with us. It's even gotten to the point, you know, well, obviously one is responsible growth versus the level of flood risk. But, even now, you look at the system and you have to question okay, do we even remain in the PLA 8499? And through the questioning I think that I'll talk about that a little bit more.",1276,1310,Testimony,For,CA
8699,"We also have changing societal expectations. I have a little bit different take than Ellen did on the Katrina. Really, if you weren't watching the whole Katrina, I would be surprise dbecause everyone was. But, one of the reasons that we had $4 billion worth of bonds passed in 2006, was because of a hurricane. And you would say, "Why? You don't have hurricanes in Sacramento." Because the flooding that occurred in Louisiana was not because of the hurricane, it was a levee failure. So immediately, once they were going, the army corps was going to repair that levee,  then it became where's the next highest-risk place the United States? It's Sacramento because we have sixteen hundred miles, as they said, the largest flood system.",1310,1356,Testimony,For,CA
8719,"But, unfortunately, as the hurricane goes away, then droughts happen and people forget, right? And the interest wanes, so you go from $4 billion worth to really $100 million, because $295 million of the new bond is really just for the delta. So it really changes the dynamics over time of the state's ability to maintain the system they have responsibility for. And, at same time, the legislature of course they responded, because they're watching the news and reading the headlines and oh my God, we're the biggest, you know, risk. So then the year after the bombs, they passed a big package of bills and the societal expectations change.",1356,1391,Testimony,For,CA
8733,"So, one of those was that the legislature said hey, we want to create a higher level of protection for the urban areas within the state plan of  flood control. So, then they mandated a brand new 200 year level protection, which was not defined, still is not really defined. So, now our cities and counties are under a deadline to try to get that done and that will affect their ability to have any growth. Natomas is a good example of what happens, you get a moratorium when you're unable to meet those accomplishments. And with that, I will answer questions after that.",1391,1425,Testimony,For,CA

8791,"In 2009, the legislature decided that the limited amount of state money, now and in the future, to address levee work in the delta would be far less than the needs. The council was assigned the job of determining prioritization funding for levee work in the delta. Our job is to figure out and rationalize how to prioritize spending in the delta to fulfill the state's responsibilities for myriad areas including, to name a few, risk protection, water quality, water supply, and ecosystem needs. That process is underway developing a levee investment strategy.",1530,1570,Testimony,For,CA

Our final report is expected to be provided sometime next year. A couple of final items that I don't know if others will talk about this or not. On the funding side, the army corps of engineers recently determined that there is no federal interest in two-thirds of the levees, the privately-owned levees and the delta. Because the cost, in their view, it would exceed the value protected by the levees. So that is a loss, it was anticipated of about $500 milion of federal funding that is not going to be provided if that if that view continues.",1639,1697,Testimony,For,CA

8889,"Good morning. My name is Tina Curry and I'm a deputy director with the California Office of Emergency Services and I first want to thank you, Mr. Chair and the committee for convening this hearing and the opportunity to spend just a few minutes on the front end here to talk about what Cal OES does, specific to flood preparedness and how we respond to flood disasters.",1750,1768,Testimony,For,CA
8897,"So, our job in short, is to coordinate the overall response to emergencies in California, in support of local governments who are going to be facing those emergencies. Just in this conversation so far, we've talked about fires and floods and drought. Excuse me. Even though we're here to talk about floods. You know, obviously our mission is very broad and we need to be ready for all those things, but floods are clearly important. Second to fires in California, they are the most frequent things that happen in this state and even though it has been a while, we recognize that that's one of our main priorities in terms of being ready for disaster events.",1768,1806,Testimony,For,CA
8913,"So, in terms of disaster taking many forms, I wanted to mention briefly that one way we deal with that in California is that we have a standard system for response so that local government, which may start from a reclamation district, you know, person of one, all the way up to the state agencies and the federal partners we work with, understand ahead of time how things come together in emergencies, so we have a comment system called the standardized emergency management system. We lock into that system when something happens and it facilitates the communication about what's going on. It facilitates the deployment of resources to attend to the problems that might be happening in communities and it does it in a way that thinks about consequences.",1806,1842,Testimony,For,CA
8929,"So whether it's an evacuation that is needed or, you know, flood fight or what have you, there's a common understanding and a common system that we use. And that over time in California has just proven to be the best way to deal with all kinds of emergencies, is to establish that commonality. So, I mention that because when we talk about flood response, that's the system that we're going to use.",1842,1872,Testimony,For,CA
8941,"Just to draw an example, in December, we had a series of storms in California and certainly didn't rise to the level of some of the more catastrophic disasters and floods, but it was significant. We saw it coming, we got the weather service reports, our local governments activated their emergency centers and we did as well. So, we were ready for it and sure enough, we had we had problems in several communities. We worked very closely with DWR's flood operation center, we understood when that stood up, what that means, what they were working on. And we were able to help communities during the response phase to get resources out there as things emerge during the event.",1872,1916,Testimony,For,CA
8959,"You know, so that's typically how things work in flood responses, is we'll activate that center. But, the system also allows us to have a deliberate way to work across the spectrum of state and government family, so we've got DWR here, we're focused on floods, but in any type of disaster, flood included, we'll be working with Cal Trans, we'll be working with the highway patrol for evacuations and you name it, across the board. The system also allows us access using the same structure to the federal government, so we've got federal government agencies that match-up with our state agencies and can enhance that capability if we need to pull that into our into our system to help out with a with a disaster.",1916,1954,Testimony,For,CA
8975,"Army core is kind of the natural, you know, one that we think of that very frequently and will be one of the first that is responding to a flood event should that happen in California. It also allows us access to non-government partners. So, Red Cross, you know, is obviously a partner of ours when it comes to taking care of people in times of emergency and during care and shelter. And the private-sector is a huge part of this. We'll have often utility problems in lots of different kinds of events that we have in California, so we don't we don't have any type of barriers to working with the private-sector to include our utilities, getting them what they need to facilitate access to sites where they're outages so that we can shorten those disruptions.",1954,1999,Testimony,For,CA
8993,"So, the system is in California what we would use in flood and it has served us well over different disasters, including the drought. You know, that's been a little more slow-moving, but significant for California and we've used those techniques in that same system to manage that. Our role goes beyond response. We have more that we do besides waiting for something to happen and dealing with it, we have a planning mission. We write emergency plans for California, both that articulate a response and also state-wide how we are committed to investing and lessening the effects of disasters, which is something that is called hazard mitigation.",1999,2039,Testimony,For,CA
9009,"So that's an important thing I want to elaborate a lot on the in's and out's on that. And that but we may get back to that during the questions. And we also facilitate the recovery from disasters, so once the response and the life-saving actions are completed we know we've got to help communities get back, you know, what they're you know, starting to recover some of the losses, starting to rebuild if there's damages. So, we have programs and we're able to access things, FEMA is one that comes to mind, but there's other federal agencies and state programs that we pull together in the similar structure to kind of deal with the long-haul and the long-term recovery from disasters.",2039,2076,Testimony,For,CA
9025,"And I mentioned a little bit, what we call disaster mitigation and that's our state-wide efforts to look at all the risks we face and try to lessen the impact, so we're not facing the same hazards again and again, or experiencing the same losses. So, that was a very short synopsis of what Cal OES's role in all of this including flood response. We maintain a readiness posture so that we're ready to respond, we don't know when something will happen next, but we're also committed to working with local government day to day, to you know, develop disaster plans, and make sure that our communities resilient, just echo the same themes about the importance of a distributed approach through insurance and, what have you.",2076,2115,Testimony,For,CA
9041,"And make sure that we're facilitating post-event, the recovery from events. So, we see ourselves as full spectrum that we're there in times of emergency and also when we're not in emergency to make sure that we are better prepared.",2115,2126,Testimony,For,CA
9045,"when we're not an emergency to make sure that were better prepared for great thank you very much mr",2126,2134,NULL,Indeterminate,CA
9047,"Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm Gary Bardini. I serve as the Deputy Director for the Department of Water Resources. I thought it would be, kind of to really capture this year in water. And I think we talked about the drought, but there's a number of things that happened in administration. One is really the progressing of the California water action plan. Within the California water action plan, the administration highlighted a number of areas related to water reliability, restoration, and water quality improvements in the system, delta management, but more importantly, it also reinforces the needs and improvements in flood management, along with the aspects of financing.",0,38,Testimony,For,CA
9065,"With that, we've had the passage of both Proposition 1, which is driven a lot by the, you know, the structuring of the finance you need under the water action plan. And of course, we had ground water legislation. While I think all these are important because they really were significant, I think changes and where we're moving in water management, ultimately trying to move towards sustainable water management in the state. And of course, sustainable means dealing with too little and then in this case, too much. And I think the videos reflect that quite well.",38,66,Testimony,For,CA
9079,"Within that, the Department of Water Resources typically organizes itself around the management of that under three major areas. One is a continuation of strength in regional governments and management. In the aspect of local systems and financial assistance, we also provide significant technical and planning support to the efforts outlined. And then lastly, we deal with a lot of the inner regional management of infrastructure improvements in management of systems. Now the way the state water project, but also the state planned flood control that we're talking about today. With that and within the flood, has been essentially what is a major driver in the management, has been essentially two reports.",66,99,Testimony,For,CA
9093,"One was the flood future report that Ellen used some of the information on, which provides a state-wide perspective of the flood management challenges and then of course, more importantly within the state plan of flood control facilities has been the Central Valley Flood Protection plan from 2012. Within that, it really recognizes the challenges of both, essentially both the capital or the loss of life potential and more importantly, the aspects of the actual consequences economically that occur.",99,128,Testimony,For,CA
9105,"Within that Central Valley Flood Plan, which has been essentially a prominent focus of the current financing, both on Proposition 1E and 84, is that essentially we recognize that essentially, in the challenges within that system, both of essentially maintaining the urban economies, protecting agricultural courses, and maintaining the ecosystems in which the system lies, we laid out a plan of essentially estimated at $14 billion - $17 billion of investment needed moving forward. At which time, we've moved under the flood safe initiative,  a number of initiatives to help towards improving that system.",128,166,Testimony,For,CA
9121,"And, if you look at the course of the period since 2006, the state of California, working through many of the folks around this table, have invested in themselves over $3 billion in that and we're looking for putting three-quarters or so of the current bond, financing and culminating with the remaining $1 billion or so plus that we look to do over the next five years.",166,188,Testimony,For,CA
9131,"Within that, we partner closely with local agencies and federal agencies, and Rick will give more about the core's role, which most of this is still within the federal flood control system. With that, what I did provide just to give at least an indication of what's done, there is a map that shows a lot of the investment over this period that just kind of reflects the activity which I did provide. And, within that, this map here really reflects associate investment, essentially in three principle areas of programs: one within the state plan of flood control facilities, which is heavily in the central valley and are kind of depicted in the orange area.",188,225,Testimony,For,CA
9147,"There are those parts that are still in the delta that are outside the state plan of flood control, which is kind of reflected. And then we still continue to provide support state-wide in projects, and the map kind of reflects essentially a lot of the activities that we've supported. Principally, in the implementation of this, the department basically continues to promote programs towards emergency management, which Tina kind of reflected. We also do O&M, in this particular Sacramento valley, both the channels and levee maintenance. To go further, we have an extensive flood plain management program, we work with FEMA on, to continue to try to address the flood plain management issues, and Melinda kind of reflected a little bit on the challenges there.",225,263,Testimony,For,CA
9149,"And then lastly, it's been the aspects of continuation of the project improvements. Typically, the project improvements in the central valley have been focused on three principle areas: continuation of the rural management, the urban areas, and providing a larger system improvements, like the bypass or et cetera. Last thing, I would just kinda recognize is that we are in a period of extensive implementation with the bond floods, but we're also looking towards the planning of a post-bond period and with the adoption of the 2017 central valley flood plan, and within that I see that we will basically focus much more not only the improvement side, of where to go beyond the initial estimates, but also be looking for how do we improve our operation and maintenance, and how would that look moving forward, along with dealing residual flood risk and emergency management that can be required moving forward.",229,305,Testimony,For,CA
9183,"And then lastly, I think the authorities issue, which I know we kind of described. The aspects of stable financing and financing for flood management and particularly, the multi benefit side in connection will be a challenge moving forward. We hope to shape the conversation in the 2017 plan.",305,325,Testimony,For,CA
9193,"Great. Thank you very much and Mr. Poeppelman, thank you so much for your patience. I've been very much anticipating your presentation.",325,335,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9197,"Thank you. And good morning to everybody and the core appreciates being invited to come over and share. A lot of things, you're going to hear some repetition because I think one of my. Well, first of all, I'm Rick Poeppleman. I'm chief of engineering division here in the Sacramento district Corps of Engineers and I'm the levee safety officer for the district and the dam safety officer. Then going kind of a little bit beyond that, I know we're focusing mostly on the central valley, but I just wanted to say we have a district office in San Francisco that kind of with the coastal area. And then in southern California, we have a Los Angeles district office that deals with the things down there.",335,375,Testimony,For,CA
9213,"So, just to kind of give you a perspective, we have a large presence in California. The Sacramento district is one of our larger districts in the entire corps, and part of that's because of the flood situation and all the projects that we have out here. But probably the thing that I want to emphasize the most, is the partnership, and you've heard of that, the multi layers of government.",375,407,Testimony,For,CA
9225,"And, it is true, we are integral. We talk every day with Leslie's group. I mean it's a constant with the Department of Water Resources. We are in regular meetings, whether it's for our planning studies that dove tail with what the state's doing and in  some of the ongoing design and construction work, there's constant coordination and communication.",407,425,Testimony,For,CA
9231,"It has its own challenges, it doesn't mean it's perfect, but, there is a significant effort of partnering going on. And you know, the corps in our civil works mission, we plan, we design, we construct. In some cases we operate, but, mostly we oversee. We help oversee and own from a federal perspective, on projects we've participated in. And there's also an element of emergency response when we're called in to help in large disasters. A lot of times, you know, the state takes that action and, usually FEMA is also part of that.",425,469,Testimony,For,CA
9249,"I guess a couple examples: there's a joint operation center located here, in Sacramento, for the valley that helps orchestrate the operation of the reservoirs and monitoring levees. You know, all that stuff integrates together. The DWR, it's actually in their facility. The Bureau of Reclamation owns a number of dams with flood control space and the corps of engineers, when the time is right, we sit down and look at how we're operating in a flood event. So, that's kind of an example.",469,507,Testimony,For,CA
9263,"A couple of the things... So you've already heard some of this, but there's statistics out there, there's 6,500 miles of levees in the central valley and about 1,600 of that are part of what we call the federal system, kind of the main stem of the Sacramento, San Joaquin and some significant tributaries are the primary focus of that.",507,533,Testimony,For,CA
9273,"Then in addition to that, the dams there's about, you know kind of the significant dams, there's about 34 plus or minus dams that have flood control space that the federal government either, about half of those we operate directly and the other half, it's either state reclamation or local flood control irrigation district.  So, all of that kind of gets coordinated and, ties into the levee systems.",533,565,Testimony,For,CA
9287,"I think it's been stated already, but I want to emphasize that we don't own really any of the levees. We provide some federal oversight and we work closely with the local maintaining agencies, flood control districts, reclamation districts, the Central Valley Flood Protection board and DWR to make that work. So, that's kind of the general piece of that. A couple things that I wanted to add, kind of getting into our planning, design, and construction.",565,595,Testimony,For,CA
9299,"So, one of the things that we bring a fair amount of technical capability to the table, but I think one of the big things is that we try to bring a chunk of financing and funding to the table. And, you all know that's been a bit of a struggle for the federal government to figure that out. But, planning studies for instance, that we participate in it's a fifty fifty cost-share usually, where the feds pay in fifty and then the local entities are paying fifty of that. And then when we get into the next phase, where we're designing and constructing, it's typically about a sixty five percent federal and a thirty five percent state, local government cost-share. Usually, you know, that's a good thing, that's a big part of what we do and how we help.",595,653,Testimony,For,CA
9321,"Let's see, I will say. So, get more into probably the levee system in the central valley. Some of the things that we're doing, and kind of how we operate. So, the corps and it kind of ties back to Katrina, we've been since then, kinda heightened our awareness and funding that goes into how we look at levees, how much effort we're putting into it. So we've been on this, essentially five-year cycle to do very detailed, periodic inspections of the levee systems across the country, not just here, and truly get a good idea of what their conditions are.",653,697,Testimony,For,CA
9341,"And we've also been looking at from a risk standpoint, kinda taking those inspections and applying the engineering to that. What are the risks? Where are the high-risk? Risk is really, kind of the probability of failure plus the consequences, what's behind the levees, and that kind of equates to risk. So, from the national standpoint being able to prioritize across the country, where we should be pointing our limited federal dollars and it's clear that Sacramento is a very high risk area. The valley, essentially, not just the city of Sacramento.",698,731,Testimony,For,CA
9355,"So, lots of lots of significant urban areas behind levees that we know they weren't originally engineered and constructed very well, or they just haven't been funded for the for the proper O&M over the years. So, in that light, just kind of real roughly, some of the things and they've been touched on when you saw in the videos. Some of the significant issues that we have: encroachments, whether it's buildings, abandoned pipes that go through that have no closures, lots of road activities.",732,769,Testimony,For,CA
9373,"So those are the kind of things that we see that inhibit the performance of the levee directly or inhibit operation and maintenance. And frankly, there was a little bit of pain getting that going.",769,783,Testimony,For,CA
9377,"I think the response from the Central Valley Flood Protection Board and the LMA's has been fantastic, realizing hey, yeah, we need to figure out how to do this and, it's worth seeing significant improvements in the last few years as a result of our inspections and our coordination with the DWR.",783,812,Testimony,For,CA
9391,"The last point I wanted to bring up, and it ties into the overall flood protection and it's part of our planning process. The state DWR, the Central Valley Flood Protection Board have similar views, but it's really about risk. How do we invest our limited dollars, where's the right place to make that investment first. So, that's what we want to do, we want to look at those high-risk areas and make sure we're doing that first and then kind of work our way down, from a risk perspective.",812,850,Testimony,For,CA
9407,"You're probably aware of some of the examples. The Folsom flood control project, the new dam and spill way that's moving along, it's pretty far into it. We just got authorized and appropriated for the Natomas levee system to finish, to start designs and construction to try to finish that work that the state SAFETA partnered on. They did probably about half of that works so, we're pleased to finish that off. The basin, that's project has been authorized and that's being done again by the locals and the state, a big chunk of that with the bond money, because the federal government is not ready, doesn't have the money to fund everything. So that's being done, we provide some oversight to that.",850,895,Testimony,For,CA
9423,"And then the kind of the big planning studies that are kind of on the cusp, but we're getting close to the end on, again working closely with the state, the American river, the Sacramento river levees, the Sacramento project and the Stockton area levee projects. So again, I want to thank you, thank the state for inviting us over and I think we have a complicated, but very productive and strong partnership.",895,931,Testimony,For,CA
9437,"Great. Thank you very much. You guys make talking about flood control like watching water fill up in a bathtub. But, to have us kick-off the Q&A, I want to get to something that a lot of people are thinking about after Friday. The governor's proposed budget has $1.1 billion of Prop 1E money in it. Where should it be spent? How do we direct those resources?",931,954,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9445,"I'm going to try to answer Assemblyman Dahle's question earlier, first of all, since he asked if there's a list. There are actually several lists and I had mentioned that JPA's, these regional agencies have formed. Sacramento's is called Sacramento area flood control associations, Sutter Butte flood control association, or agency rather. The Stockton area that San Joaquin has one. And we have three rivers, levee improvement authority so, they've all done these.",954,985,Testimony,For,CA
9459,"So, they have these large, very civil works projects, so they're so large that they have individual projects like the Natomas that was mentioned. And so, they, within those agencies, have a list of projects if you will, that they have already initiated, some are even completed, I think Sutter Butte is on phase three now or something like that of theirs, so there's that. In addition, the Central Valley Flood Protection plan that was mentioned that was approved in 2012, is in implementation now and what they did is they split the that orange area, the 1.7 million acres that is protected by the state plan and flood control system into six regions.",985,1023,Testimony,For,CA
9475,"And those regions came up with regional flood management plans and I know like, one of the regions, had 120 projects on their list. So, there is lists if you will, that do exist as a result of those activities. And the $1.1 billion dollars yeah, it's a lot of money to spend all in one year, so I would like to hear from the department. Is it a phased spending, you know, and, how that's going to work?",1023,1069,Testimony,For,CA
9495,"But those large civil works projects obviously they're ongoing and will need that continued funding to get them up, and the cities and counties really still need to get up that 200 year level of protection. They were given a legislative deadline to be able show adequate progress by 2016, that's important. And then not to be forgotten, we can't really forget the rural levees has to make system work. You have to make those urban, as you make them better, you potentially then have to make the rural ones a little bit better.",1069,1086,Testimony,For,CA
9501,"Yeah, I agree. There's big lists and every project has been given aspects on this. I think one of the limiting factors for moving up is now then, getting through the aspects of the design of the permitting of them. But there's always aspects of essentially, a cost-share between both federal, state and local agencies. So, the availability of the federal budget to support many of the projects Melinda just talked about, is a factor. The ability to raise capital in the 218 is an issue at a local agency, so we're always in a kind of a balance between all three agencies or three levels of government, with their budgets towards that large list.",1086,1121,Testimony,For,CA
9517,"And then, we go through, I think Rick reflected a bit of a prioritization, of the effort. So I'd say generally, in the Central Valley Flood plan, it reflects a prioritization of moving not only to essentially urban improvements, but for system improvements like the bypass and I think we're making progress on that in alignment of our agencies. And those take longer to bring to readiness, but I think the aspect of broader benefit or value, are significant.",1121,1148,Testimony,For,CA
9529,"And then we have maintaining a rural system and we continue to progress that with a lot of the maintaining agencies. So I think we have essentially a long list of projects, I think we're kind of basically more in a prioritization against that list.",1148,1161,Testimony,For,CA

9553,"I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but I'm looking at my table trying to do the math in my head. But, I think you looked at eighty to eighty five percent is in the construction or in that category. I will say the aspects of driving the evaluation, both our flood risk management mapping program with significant effort that we did with the corps of engineers. But, I would say the planning part is really a small fraction.",1204,1229,Testimony,For,CA
9565,"Great, and just as a follow-up for Mr. Gallagher. If you can provide those numbers to committee staff, we will circulate it with committee members as well as Mr. Gallagher who's joining us today. Members at this time?",1229,1243,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9571,"One thing that we hear brought up time and time again, is that the delta is a critical piece to the flood control puzzle. Tell us a little bit more about how we're grappling with that.",1243,1258,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9575,"Well, as I explained, the legislature reached the point in 2009. It said we have so many demands in support of a healthy delta levee system, and the funds just don't measure up to the level of the demands. So, we were assigned, the Delta Stewardship Counsel was assigned responsibility to develop a prioritization plan.",1258,1286,Testimony,For,CA
9587,"While we are developing the finer points in that, there exists today in the delta plan, guidance that prioritizes urban protection and then protection of assets, and then thirdly, agricultural value property. That's an over-simplification, but that's useful I think, it's enough detail for these purposes.",1286,1307,Testimony,For,CA
9597,"So, over the last several years, the Department of Water Resources has funded, through this inventions program, matching funds to the reclamation districts that are in the delta in support of those local projects as well as cooperating with the central valley flood protection board and their projects on the periphery.",1307,1339,Testimony,For,CA
9609,"So we have, essentially, a practice now in the delta of attempting to bring up all levees to a minimum standard and that minimum standard probably varies, whether it's urban protection or agricultural protection. But currently, only about thirty one percent of the levees meet a minimum standard. So, we've got a long ways to go and the department and limited funds that they have distributed have been directed at trying to address those areas that are out of the standard and to bring them up. At the rate we're going, it's going to take many years to even meet that minimum standard.",1341,1379,Testimony,For,CA
9625,"You raise a really good point. Ms. Terry did you want to add on to that?",1379,1384,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9627,"Yeah, I did. if you think about the flood system that the state now owns and operates, it was proposed and approved in 1917 and started construction soon after that. So it came first, but it then became a convenient water conveyance supply, conveyance system because of course, you know, where that water was coming was from the same place where the floodwater's coming from, so those levees than became the conveyance system and then the delta became the hub for the pumping to be able to export that water where our growing population is located.",1384,1420,Testimony,For,CA
9643,"So, it's really interesting because I have to participate with another hat that I wear, and a lot of delta stuff and they talk about flows a lot, but it's always flows for water supply, you know, but for flood, we have flood flows. There's just two different kinds of flows that you're managing. And, I think really, if you think about our state now, we have a large population where there's a health and safety issue of having drinking water available to them. And so, from a political sense they're more powerful and they can beat that drum louder because it is really important to them. And then the population that's protected by the flood system, we're much smaller and our drum often does not beat as loudly and we don't get as much attention.",1420,1459,Testimony,For,CA
9659,"So, unfortunately in particular since really 2009, when the delta package was done, when you talked about levees, all anyone ever talked about was delta levees, forgetting that the state has a responsibility and liability for 1,600 miles of levees from Red Bluff down to Fresno. So, we see the funding for the rest of the system maybe wane off a little bit. And when it comes to coordination, we really could and should, do a better job of coordinating and I'll just give a couple examples that are from the delta stewardship council's plan.",1459,1496,Testimony,For,CA
9675,"One of the big issues, I'll call it the elephant in the room, that wasn't brought up by any of the speakers, so I'll bring it up is vegetation on levees. The army corps, as part of their periodic inspections in determining whether you're eligible for PLA 8499, has a policy that you can't have any vegetation on the levees, and our state for decades they were not enforcing that, so our levees have quite a bit. It is very expensive to remove, we've written a great, sixty page reason why we couldn't and shouldn't both from an ecosystem and cost standpoint. But in the meantime, the dealt stewardship council has their plan wants to add 21 new miles of vegetation on levees,  which are primarily project levees, which are part of the system.",1496,1542,Testimony,For,CA
9697,"So, now you have a conflict between what allows you to remain eligible for a hundred-percent funding by the federal government, when there's a levee failure, because they'll pay one hundred percent to repair it, but you're no longer eligible. So, now we have a conflict with our own state policy. So those things, you can make a decision, but nobody's really coordinating to figure those kinds of things out. The same with, you could say, the BDCP.",1542,1571,Testimony,For,CA
9709,"They have a conservation measure to inundate the Yolo bypass, which is the major workhorse of that state plan of flood control system, to inundate it for fish because it's the ESA mitigation for their pumping facilities that are part of the CBP and SWP. But that may conflict with the central valley flood protection plan, those six regions, so the lower Sac valley, they've got a list of projects, it may conflict with that. Now, it doesn't have to, because we really can, if we're smart to really coordinate it, we can figure out ways to bundle those together, so that we're achieving the water supply benefits, the flood benefits, and the ecosystem benefits as part of that. But really, with that kind of coordination at that level, is just not going on.",1571,1617,Testimony,For,CA
9731,"So, the big fear for a lot of the locals because you even heard Ellen, you know, like half of the money that goes in is from the locals. But, even the state should be worried because we've already invested more than three billion, but let's just talk about Prop 184, $3 billion in the recent years since 2006. Well, any of these new water supply projects that are proposed as biological opinions, or BDCP, or in the delta plan,  if they undermine those investments that were made to increase or reduce the risk of levee failure, well that's a lost investment, if you will, on our flood size.  So that's why, you know, that coordination is just so critical.",1617,1659,Testimony,For,CA
9749,"Well, Ms. Terry, I want to say thank you for sharing these ideas. We've got the team right here around the table, and if you guys are nodding thinking some of these things might be good, let's flesh this out and see if there's a better way that we can do this coordination. I also want to thank Ms. Terry for your response to Ms. Hanak's presentation as well, when you were speaking earlier. But you raise an important point about enforcement, and for the flood protection board, which has some enforcement duties. Can you talk a bit about some of those challenges and how that is a threat, how those violations could be a threat to us, or perhaps an opportunity to strengthen our flood protection?",1660,1700,Discussion,Neutral,CA
9765,"Certainly, and yes, you've correctly identified that. That is one of the major threats that we have to the levee, the hundred-year-old system that has been, over the years, somewhat neglected, that has lots of old things on and around it. And of the agencies here, we are the one charged with taking care of that, on the project levees. So, we're talking about the 1,600 miles of levees and there are most of the levees in the delta that you're talking about, two-thirds of those I think are not project levees, so those we don't have direct jurisdiction over those.",1700,1739,Testimony,For,CA
9781,"But of the ones that we do, we've put a program together, in conjunction with the help that we received from the legislature in 2013, and just last year we passed regulations to compliment that we're really ramping up our enforcement program. We're working with local partners and DWR to identify properties and to match funds with others who can help get some of these things out. But it is very challenging.",1739,1767,Testimony,For,CA

One of the other big challenges that we face, which is something we've recently identified, we've been working with the division of engineering within the department to identify our property rights even. Many of our",1767,1804,Testimony,For,CA

By no means it's the end of the process or the end of the conversation, but it is a good beginning place for us.",405,428,Author,Indeterminate,CA
10317,"First, it gives us a balance on time budget in the future, which prudently ensures that we'll have fiscal stability in California. The recent passage of proposition 2 plays a big role in providing that stability. The budget projects that the rainy day fund will have a balance of 6 billion dollars in four years. Before last year, we had a zero budget in terms of that. I want to recognize, obviously, the assembly itself for the early advocacy for proposition 2 and I want to thank the members on both sides of the hour who worked together to put this on the ballot last year successfully.",428,463,Author,Indeterminate,CA
10333,"Second, it identifies the governor's budget, identifies liabilities, and begins to address those liabilities. Again, proposition 2 helps provide a funding source, especially to eliminate K12 deferrals and local mandate debts. We've taken on PERS and STRS already and now we're looking at deferred maintenance and retiree benefits. I appreciate the governor is working with us to slowly and carefully diffuse these liabilities so our budget has fewer risk involved.",463,491,Author,Indeterminate,CA
10345,"Finally, the budget does something that I'm pretty excited about. That is that it provides additional funding for schools. In this case, billions of additional dollars of funds have been allocated for schools and I'm sure you will hear a lot more about that later on. But I'm also glad that the budget that the governor has given us gives some areas to improve upon his proposal. Most of us know that this date still suffers from a high-level poverty. California has the highest poverty rate of any of the states in the nation. We have thousands of underemployed an unemployed Californians who should be contributing to our economy today. We have thousands of children who are home who should probably be in early child development programs for learning. This is an unfunded poverty liability, and like the governor, we want to begin the thoughtful discussion about how we can reduce this liability as well.",491,541,Author,Indeterminate,CA

The governor has been a vocal advocate of paying down debt, and for that we're very pleased. This budget proposes debt payments to our schools, cities, and counties. Yet even under this proposal, we are concerned that we may not be eliminating enough debts and liabilities.

This budget does make, as the chair mentioned in her opening statements, major investments in education.

Also, since the 2014 budget act was enacted we've had some additional increased expenditures. Mainly the states Medi-Cal population is up following two years very large increases due to health care reform. We do estimate that the Medi-cal population will be over 12 million individuals in the 2015/2016 budget year, which is nearly a third of the state's population. Also we are seeing increase costs in that program mainly related to administrative actions being taken by the federal government.",906,955,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

10551,"Even though the budget is balanced and we do have the 2.8 billion dollar rainy day fund there do continue to be other risks related to the budget that we have remained concerned about. One of them was the major action taken by the president late in 2014 related to immigration. We continue to better understand the impacts of that action on our states major entitlement programs, and the impacts could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but we have not built those impacts in at this time.",975,1010,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
10565,"The next issue is a major one and it's a big reason why we have the rainy day fund and that is the threat of recession.

So there is a threat. The economy does continue to grow at this time though.",1010,1048,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
10583,"And then finally, the other threat or risk to the state's budget is really the states accumulated long-term liabilities. If you turn to page three in the slides that I've handed out there's a listing of the debts and liabilities that are eligible for repayment by proposition 2. This list actually doesn't include things like deferred maintenance, which is another 66 billion dollars that is needed for that liability, but we do propose that the budget proposes the 1.2 billion dollars in the budget year to pay down those debts and liabilities thanks to proposition 2. Just a little recap of proposition 2. It does require - it's a constitutional amendment - it does require deposits into the rainy day fund that are 1.5% of annual general fund revenues. And then any time we have spikes in capital gains, and capital gains become more than 8% of general fund tax revenues, those additional capital gains revenues would also go into the rainy day reserve.",1048,1115,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

Another 250 million is being used to pay back proposition 98 settle up.",1115,1143,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

10655,"The budget also continues to make investments in higher education. The budget provides nearly a billion dollars in additional monies for the community college system. Also, it continues to implement the multi-year funding stability plan for the UC and CSU. This is the third year of that plan. The budget provided 5% in each of the last two years. This budget provides for a 4% growth, which equates to a $120 million dollars for each of the segments, both UC and CSU. The budget is predicated, though, on the University of California and CSU holding tuition flat through the budget year. The administration continues to make significant efforts to focus really on cost containment at the universities and reducing the time it takes to get to get a degree from the systems. Just this week, there is going to be a committee established at the UC board of regents related to the cost structure of the university and  the goal of that committee will be to really drill down into the University of California cost structure and get a better understanding and also make recommendations and actions to the board of regents on how to make the cost structure of the University of California sustainable for the long-run.",1219,1310,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

The state has has taken several actions over the last two years to try and mitigate those very real and difficult realities of poverty and income inequality in our state. First, I want to talk again about the implementation of healthcare reform. This was a very major initiative that the federal government passed and the state has implemented fully including the optional expansion, which extended health care to millions of Californians that never had access to health care before. The expenditures related to health care reform are about $16.3 billion dollars, if you include both the federal funds and the general fund.

This is really building on the efforts of the federal government and congress' three authorization of the work force investment and opportunities act just this past year.

Then also, last year, as part of the community colleges budget there was an effort to change the enhanced non credit rate to provide parity with the credit rate. So these are courses that are not necessarily being offered with the end goal of an AA degree, but do provide a skills based certificate, or some sort of certificate, that can help somebody get a higher wage job.",1574,1625,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

10833,"Also, this budget strengthens our infrastructure. Infrastructure and deferred maintenance continue to be a significant issue for the state. The voters passed proposition 1 in November, our water bond, and this budget allocates $533 million of those proposition 1 monies to continue to implement the states water action plan. The water action plan is a multi pronged effort to really improve our water resources for the state including restoring native habitats, making more resilience our water management infrastructure, and then also improving the reliability of the water supplies for our agricultural industry, our businesses, and also our urban consumers.",1652,1701,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

This includes 25% being allocated to the high-speed rail system, 20% to the sustainable communities, including low-income housing, 10% for transit and rail, and then 5% for transit operations. The additional 40% are allocated in the budget act along the lines of the investments that were made last year all in the effort to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in our state and make our state more resilient to climate change over the long-term.",1702,1752,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
10877,"Deferred maintenance, as I mentioned, continues to be a major issue for the state. Our estimates are that deferred maintenance is as much a liability as much as $66 billion.

10893,"Finally, this budget works towards ongoing and expanding funding sources for the largest share of our deferred maintenance liability, which is our state highways and roads, and especially our key freight corridors. So while we don't have a specific proposal related to an ongoing funding source, I think there's a very and important recognition that the state's highways - there's been many things done for the states multi-modal transportation system, but the core state highways do need ongoing funding in order to keep up on the maintenance.",1787,1831,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
10911,"Then finally, the state's budget does pay down debts and address long-term liabilities. We've talked already a bit about proposition 2 and the $1.2 billion for debt repayment there. We also repay all the remaining school deferrals, we make the final payment of those economic recovery bonds that were used to balance the budget as far back as 2002. Also, as part of the trigger from the 2014 budget act, the increased revenues are allowing the budget to provide $533 million for local mandate reimbursements these are mandate costs that have been owed local governments since before 2004.",1831,1875,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

In the very last slide I have in this packet, it's a pictorial graph, of what will happen if there's no action on this liability. It will grow to well over $300 billion over the next several decades. We propose a multi-pronged effort that would include a pre-funding strategy that would be undertaken at the bargaining table with our state employee unions, as well as legislation and also working directly with PERS to preserve this health care benefit for career workers and also work on ways that we can reduce the overall cost structure of employee health care and retiree health care by offering high deductible health plans and health savings accounts.

It also provides a description of the major changes in the governor's budget. Like you, we have lots of questions about many aspects of the governor's plan, and we'll be spending the next several weeks working with the administration to get more information for you. In some case, we will offer you options or alternatives to governor's proposals, in other case we will be making recommendations to you. Those documents will be coming out as I say throughout early February and throughout the month.",4,45,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
10979,"I just want to make a few comments, if I could Madam Chair. Your budget is very much dominated by two issues: proposition 98 and proposition 2. If we can start with talking about the current year 2014/2015, it is completely dominated by proposition 98. As Ms. Bosler noted, they have brought up their revenue estimates in the current year by roughly $2.5 billion and almost all of it goes to schools. I know for some members, and a lot of people out there in the public, they have a hard time understanding how that could be. That is how come there's no no money that is available for other priorities in the budget? It's basically because of the way we decided to payoff various school-related obligations when we have a down year in prop 98, but that is the case.",45,100,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11001,"The money goes to schools, that's great for schools, in the current year because the school years already started. These increases in the revenues basically then available for you to spend on one-time purposes. We think the administration has been very wise in paying off the deferrals, paying off mandates. In the current year, we actually think that you're going to have even more money than what the administration estimates. The current cash flow already exceeds what they're proposing for the year, and depending on what we learn in the next couple of day, high-income taxpayers are making their estimated payments actually by today. So next week we'll have a little better idea about how good your 2014/2015 cash and revenues will be, and we won't even know for sure in May, but we'll have even more information by then. But what we have said is that you likely will have a billion or two more in the current year.",100,150,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11025,"Now what are the implications of that? Well, again, because of our formulas all of that will go to schools. So, there again you're going to have to explain to many of your advocacy groups and your constituents why is it that you could have funding going up by $4 billion and none of it is available for non 98 purposes. That's the way that we decided to implement the formulas. Now there are other implications and some are more important for your overall budget and your non 98 part of the budget. If we have this kind of revenue surge, which we actually talked about back in our November report, you're going to permanently increase your 98 obligations. If it is a temporary surge and your capital gains revenues and revenues fall down to lower levels and subsequent years, you could actually be worse off in your non 98 budget because you would have been committed to higher 98, and yet you're revenues won't be able to support those -- they'll have to support your 98 -- you won't have the money left over, and you might actually have to take a hit to your non 98 portion the budget.",150,215,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11055,"That's also an implication for schools; that if we did have a recession -- not a recession, even a downturn -- you could have made commitments if you provide all of these monies on an ongoing basis in the 2015/2016 year you might have to make cutbacks in subsequent years. So what it is really just a caution for-you about what you may face on your non 98 part of  your budget, and you even need to be careful and your 98 budget. The administration, I think wisely in their 2015/2016 plan for schools, has some one-time monies built in. I think that's wise because then if your 98 spending has to go down in subsequent years, you don't have to take as big a hit on your ongoing commitments that school districts would have already made.",215,258,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11075,"So, we are in this time when a lot is happening with revenues, it's a very good time as far as the level that's coming in, but because of the complicated complex fiscal structures we have you do need to be cautious, so that we don't end up in situations that are even close to approaching what we faced in 2008/2009, 2009/2010 etc.",258,282,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11085,"As far as the overall governors approach, we think basically it's a prudent plan. We're able to build-up our surpluses somewhat, we pay off a lot of debts.  Where the money is in schools the governor, I think, wisely puts it into the local control funding formula. There are increased cost in some of the health and human services programs. These are typically for new commitments. In fact, I think the only major new commitment is related to the governor's proposal to restore 7% reduction hours in the in-home supportive services program, but there are cost increases related to Medi-Cal, IHSS just to maintain your existing programs. So once you do that there's not a lot of left money left over for any sort of new commitments.",282,324,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11105,"Let me just comment on four particular proposals, or issues, that are in the governor's budget. The first is on the reserve level. I think the chair and the vice chair's comments sort of provided the book ends for me. At $3.4 billion years end, at the end 2015/2016 years which the governor's budget proposes, that's the biggest reserve we've had in awful long-time, and that is good news and the fact is we are building on our reserves. The vice chair's comment comment though about how quickly that can turn around is also appropriate. Our revenue structure so volatile that in a relatively short time you can lose a lot of money.

It could be that on the natural, because a prop 2, that reserve amount will grow, but I think you should really target a comfortable level of reserves given where we are on -- if you look at the financial markets --where we are as Ms. Bosler mentioned in the length of the recovery, we should be building up our reserves towards that 10% target that the people approved in proposition 2 and we've made a very good down payment, but I think we have a ways to go there.",370,396,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11137,"On the retiree health. We're very pleased to see the administration place emphasis on paying off this debt. I think the vice chair mentioned, we do have tens of billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities on our pensions and various things; however, we at least have mechanisms in place to pay those off over time. With your CALstrs agreement, under CALpers we amortize those liabilities. We are addressing all of our big ones with the exception of the retiree health benefits. This is a completely pay as you go system. We owe $72 billion between special funds, federal state. We're very pleased that the administration has given lots of visibility to this issue. Unfortunately, the administration doesn't give any money towards this issue. I think that's okay, maybe that comes later. This is a complex issue it is going to take you some time to work through, but you do have proposition 2 that is out there. This is what it was for, and you have at least 15 years, in effect, guaranteed roughly $800 million a year, and perhaps even more when we have good capital gains years.",396,468,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11167,"We would just suggest you this is a great source of paying down those unfunded liabilities towards your retiree health, and it should be viewed as a as a real prime mechanism, if this is one of the liabilities that you want to address.",468,483,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11173,"On K12 schools, again, if you agree with the governor that most of the money should go in the LCFF, paying off the debts, not a lot of issues there. One area where the governor has proposed an important change, and we think we commend them for racing, it is an area of workforce development. This is a very complex issue where they want to try to bring more coordination to the various regional efforts, but it's a very complex one. You've got 70 consortium that are for adult education, you've got 15 community college consortium, you got 45 labor related boards, and bringing these all together and bringing some sort of coherence to them is going to be a tough job. I think that's an area where you need to start work early, but again we appreciate the administration raising the issue and I think there's a lot of room for improvement.",483,538,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11195,"Let me just end with a couple comments about higher education. Clearly, you have a lot of different perspectives on higher education from the assembly, the senate, the segments, and the governor, and I think there's been a lot of good discussion about the cost structure for our segments, about how we should fund enrollment. The governor, for example, seems very critical of enrollment base funding for the universities, and yet proposes enrollement base funding for the community colleges. We don't think it has to be all-or-nothing. We think that having enrollment targets, for example, is a good thing. It signals what you want to get out of the money that you invest in the systems. It's not a be all end-all. You want other outcome measures that help you. I think, there's a lot of discussion on the way that we fund the segments that you're going to want to have, and particularly with regards to tuition, which has gotten probably the most light and heat, and a lot of different views on this.",538,594,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11223,"I would strongly urge you to think about a longer-term fee policy. The reason why people argue now about who pays and how much tuition should go up or should keep flat, is because you frankly have no policy on what you want students and families to pay of their university, and how much you want to state to fund. If you could agree on a share of cost policy, that families will pay this percentage, the state will pay this percentage. What that does is that it takes away a lot of the discussion that you're now having, and it focuses sharply on the issue of why are costs going up. Again, this is an issue that the governor has properly raised and focused on. The speaker, through her proposal to a zero based budgeting, but if you know that whatever costs are going to go up, that families and students are going to have to share proportionally with the state, then your emphasis, all of your focus and attention, is on why are costs going up? Do they need to go up? Do we need to look at the cost structures? Do we need to fund research differently or less emphasis on different aspects of what we now pay?",594,670,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11259,"So, absent of fee policy, every year you're going to have these debates about the universities threatening to raise tuition, you're not wanting them to raise tuition, and I don't think it's particularly helpful over the years.

Okay, I want to thank both of you for presenting the budget for us from your from the finance office and from the LAO,  the different perspectives of the budget and recommendations. We are going to open it up for questions and comments. Before we begin, let me just make sure we're clear about a couple things.

11281,"In the current year. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask a question with one of the comments made by finance. You listed a number of things in terms of addressing poverty and income inequality. I was trying to figure out how these two factored into our budget. One the increase of minimum wage and the extended sick leave, as budget items in terms of our expenditures of things that we're investing in.",722,749,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11291,"Obviously, both of those are not a purely budget and at all. They're much larger than that. They do impact our budget. We do have many workers in our IHSS program, in our developmentally disabled services at the regional center level. So, the minimum wage and the extension of sick leave benefits to those workers did have an impact on some of our state programs, but that's really a minor piece. Really I think the mention of those is important in the context that, you know, poverty is is a very and complex problem and one at that there needs to be many different tools to address. So, while we have our critical safety net programs like CALworks and SSISSP, we also have these other efforts as a society that we take to try and also mitigate poverty and the income inequality that has really plagued our nation and our state. That is just the overall context.",749,821,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11321,"Okay. I was kind of concerned because it gave the impression that those are really budget items, and they didn't appear to be budget items, and probably we can't take credit for it in the budget that these are things we've done to alleviate poverty. They are policy issues that we took and probably effect the private industry more sometimes than us in terms of a minimum wage and sick leave. So, I didn't want us to think that we had done some great work in the area of poverty by doing those two things. We've done some great stuff in terms of a policy and I think our private sector would probably say they took the greatest bulk in terms of investment in poverty through those particular items.",821,859,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

Is this the $10.8  billion for concentration grant or the overall local control funding formula? Because one addresses the issue of poverty and language and foster care, which is a portion of it, but not the whole piece. I am trying to figure out exactly how much of this is really for the poverty and income issue, in terms of the concentration grant that is a part of the local control funding formula.",922,955,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

Those districts that are serving more of those students will receive more money, based on the formula, but that's not how the fundings -- that's not where we started. It is difficult to say until we're fully implemented, you know, what portion of that money is going for those specific parts of the formula.",1039,1094,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

I have two questions. First one on the long-term fiscal picture. Second one specific to redevelopment and policy going forward.",1169,1191,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11479,"So first one: I appreciate the governor focusing on debt repayment, acknowledging the long-term liabilities of state employee retiree health. I'm looking forward to some of the details on how that cost curve bends so dramatically there on that graph. Appreciate the full embrace of the rainy day fund to capture the revenue spikes, capital gains which you both reference, but my continued concern is the long-term health of the budget with the expiration of proposition 30. The governor indicating that that was a temporary one-time deal. Somehow, we're going to need back fill that revenue, and the concern is the underlying volatility that prop 2 rainy day fund helps with, but it doesn't necessarily fix in terms of the volatility that both of you have talked about. I know we're going to be hearing proposals on structural tax reform, but has the governor given any indication of acknowledging that underlying volatility and a willingness to embrace something that looks at structural tax reform so we could better ride out that next downturn, which could as Mac suggests, result in severe deficits potentially?",1191,1273,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11515,"So, the approval of proposition 2 by the voters was a really important first step to reducing the volatility. That's why, you know, we took the many different proposals and really looked at -- zeroed in on --  capital gains because capital gains is the single most volatile revenue component that we have in our state's revenue system.",1273,1305,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11531,"Also, the recovery this time around with a, you know, a lot of the gains going to the highest income. This is an issue that has plagued California over the last decade or two, and will probably continue to plague California to some extent, but proposition 2, I think, with really shaving off those spikes of capital gains and putting them aside in the rainy day fund is a really an important first step to mitigating the uncertainty of the boom and bust cycles that we lived through this past decade.",1305,1341,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11547,"In terms of tax reform, this is something that, you know, our office continues -- is always looking at ways to improve the current tax structure, but we don't have any specific proposals at this time but it is something we continue and to look at. We know there's a lot of proposals that are being made in the legislature and in outside groups, and so we do continue to really drill down and look at those, but we don't have a specific proposal related to tax reform at this time.",1341,1375,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11561,"Madame Chair, just my second question on redevelopment. First, I want to apply the administration for proposing that we change the ROPS process to an annual, as opposed to a six-month. I had that in a piece of legislation; good to see that's been picked up in the budget. A question about the dissolution of redevelopment, and the original intent of redevelopment as related to dealing with urban poverty and blight. Madam Chair talks about poverty, I think, the phrase was unfunded poverty liability, I think Madam Chair said. So, there are obviously mixed results with redevelopment in terms of dealing with - as a strategy Work as a strategy for dealing with urban poverty, but it seems like there's a laser focus on dissolution harvesting assets, moving money around, but I'm trying to get a sense of what the underlying sort of policy rationale for that is? And what the replacement is really for redevelopment going forward, when you're talking about dealing with urban poverty, blight, affordable housing development in the high-cost areas and poorer areas of the state, and I am talking about a strategy to deal with working poor. It seems to me that there's not necessarily a policy discussion as related to the dissolution of redevelopment. Can you address that at all?",1375,1457,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11597,"Well, the dissolution of redevelopment is something that has been fundamental to our recovery of our state budget, and that's because that billions of dollars have been returned to schools, but also to core county services and core city services as well. So, it was a really important financial piece of our ability to move out of our recessionary time. In terms of going forward, and some of the important things and tools, as you mention that redevelopment was able to offer, last summer a new infrastructure financing district was passed and signed by the governor. We see this as a tool that can be very powerful in bringing together the different, you know, local governments to address common and difficult problems of blight and infrastructure, especially in urban areas.",1457,1532,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11629,"Also, in terms of affordable housing, a significant allocation of the cap and trade monies was allocated -- 20% -- allocated to the sustainable communities pot of money.

So, that's also an important component of our effort to really replace and mitigate some of the impact of the redevelopment dissolution.",1532,1577,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11647,"Mr. McCarty? Yes. You have a question?",1577,1582,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11649,"Thank you. Question for finance on early education and higher-end, but first just a general comment. I know there's a lot of angst that not enough was done in this budget to reinvest in critical programs in California, but, you know, that education and Prop 98 was, not certainly taken care of, but critical focusing on getting back to where we were, and nothing was hit more in the great recession than education funding, and there really is no greater effort to focus on the middle class and poverty than focusing on education from P all the way through 16. I know the big focus, as the LAO said, is Prop 98, but I want to talk a bit about the other ends of it, early education and higher ed.",1582,1627,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11669,"So first of all, in early education I see that part of the budget is to include funding for the 4,000 slots that were a part of last year's budget deal, but my understanding was there was not necessarily commitment, but  language in there to focus on all of low-income 4 year olds in California. So, is there desire from the administration to expand more than those 4,000 slots funded in the budget?",1627,1658,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11681,"So, yes, the budget does fully implement the  provisions of last year's budget, which included the additional expansion of an additional 4,000 slots for early childhood education.  I think, I don't remember the other component, but... Yeah, go ahead.",1658,1681,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11693,"Sure. There's also an increase to the reimbursement rates. There's also one-time money for quality, expansions and along with the preschool slots, there was significant investment in wrap around care. Because the state preschool is a party program, we now provide funding, which is on the non 98 cost for the rest of the day - the additional hours needed for those families to access to the preschool to provide them the childcare as well. So, I think at this point in time we are, as Ms. Bosler noted, we're fully funding the preschool expansion, the wrap around. We're fully funding the increase in reimbursement rate and we are sort of evaluating, you know, where that's gotten us, how that's working out, how the one-time money for quality is working out, and then we'll, you know, the agreement last year did include a commitment to eventually provide preschool for all low-income children. So, we'll look at further expansions in the future.",1681,1759,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11727,"So do you anticipate that would be part of - early enough to be in the May revise? Or are you looking at the out years for that?",1759,1772,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11731,"We don't have any further proposals in this budget. I think that we're looking at - these monies are new, these slots are new. We're doing our best and the Department of Education is really looking at where the gaps are currently because in some other areas of the state there's less of a gap on all the 4 year olds being covered. They're allocating those resources out it to the best fill those gaps and provide most universal coverage as possible for all low-income 4 year olds. I think as we continue to evaluate that, and as that gets implemented, we will have a better sense of where the where the gaps are. It is a continued work in progress.",1772,1818,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
11751,"My understanding is that those 4,000 slots were freed up this past summer and there was, I think from CDs estimates, over 25,000-30,000 inquiries to fill those 4,000 slots, so we know that there is a demand out there. Lastly, on the higher ed piece, I know it is a priority priority for all of us, and certainly I would like to hope that we can do more to expand access to higher ed in California.  I just wanted to focus on, you know, obviously attention has been on the University of California and and the tuition issues. So, I guess the question, as far as going back and forth on the on the fee hikes, is that certainly in this budget you mention that there is a kind of 4 year plan to get 5 and 5% to the system, plus 4 and 4, this is the 3rd year and you have that what was that 4%, which is roughly $120 million. If the University of UC regents did go ahead and go forward with their fee increase, which, you know, is significant, is the administration prepared to pull back that debt $120 million that is currently on the table for the UC system?",1818,1884,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
11781,"The way the budget is currently written is that it is budgetary controlling language. If the fees are increased in the budget year then the $120 million would not be available for the university. That's how it's currently written, yes.",1884,1900,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

So I am very supportive that we are doing that because we know that's the best way to take advantage of jobs and all throughout the state, but as you mention, it is complex because the community colleges in my district have a different job requirement than maybe a community college in Fresno and I think at the local levels, that is the best way to provide it. So, I think our grant program and how we designed it is totally appropriate.  Also with adult education, as consortium go forward, I've been attending them in my district and what I found out is that a portion of my district is doing it through the community colleges and the other portion is doing it through the high school system.

Can you walk us through what finance is thinking is why that information is not broken down so that we can really understand whether or not the finances are actually getting to the children it is intended to help?",138,198,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
12049,"So the LCFF was one component of really a major change in the way we finance our schools. Really the accountability system and how we know what school districts are doing with those monies has also changed dramatically and we now have local control accountability plans. Those really - the first-year of the implementation of those with a huge learning experience for the administration, for the Board of Education, and there's been significant hearings, hundreds of hours of hearings and significant changes to the LCAP to really focus in on that transparency aspect that you mention. That is one area where we're going to be getting more details about what is happening at the local level in terms of accountability and in terms of how does the monies are being spent. I'm going to turn it over to Nick Schweitzer to talk about when we anticipate the full implementation.",200,260,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12075,"Sure. So, I think we're rerunning those projections now. I think our regional estimate was about eight years. We're probably still on track there, plus or minus a year. It's very sensitive to what you assumes going to be the out year revenues. So, while we have significant increases in revenues as we did last year, higher than projected. We also have the Prop 30 tax increases phasing out. That will you slow down some of the revenue growth a little bit and, you know, generally we project a return to trend in terms of revenues, so you maybe a little bit less revenue growth in the future because of the higher revenues now. You can end up, you know, a round about where you thought you're going to be anyway. We're running those numbers, but I would still expect we're on track 8 years, plus or minus, you know, 1 or 2 years.",260,337,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12109,"Jennifer Kuhn, Leg. Analyst. So, when the state started implementing the LCFF, that base year, it was 72% of funded. It had more generous targets and it knew that it would take a number of years to get up to those targets. Under the governor's budget we've estimated for 2015/2016, so just a few years later the state would be 85% funded. So it made considerable progress. It would be slightly ahead of schedule in that regard. Having said that though, because the targets are COLAed, you have to have growth in the guarantee that's quite a bit faster than COLA to make a serious dent in to getting there. Under our 5 year forecast, we have the last year of the period at about 90 some percent funded. So, still it would take again a number of years. Although we appear to be on track, it really depends on what happens to the guarantee moving forward. It's very straightforward to calculate. If we were at the full rates today, it would cost the state $57 billion and $9 billion of it would be associated with supplemental concentration funding for English learners and low-income students.",337,399,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12137,"It's not quite as easy to say exactly how much that we're giving out can be associated with those students because it's really based on what they were given, and a closing of the gap, but what we do know by design how much they're supposed to get and some day we'll know exactly how much they're getting. In the end term we are really relying on these plans to have districts described to us what they're doing.

Hopefully, you have seen the recent audit by the state auditor, which was very enlightening and unbelievably disturbing in a lot of ways. I might be one that on this panel that may be looking at doing things another way, at cutting the court budget because of some of the problems that we see in that while trial court rooms are being closed all across this state for lack of funds. We're paying about 8 managers $179,000, more than your boss the governor, more than the general manager department of general services who manages thousands of employees, which is about 800 employees, averaging about $28,000 than anybody else at that same level.",434,496,Discussion,Against,CA

The audit points out about $186 million that could go directly to trial courts, which everyone who was here the last two years on the budget, that I've been here, that was the number one priority: getting money to the trial court.

I just want to know if the governor has any -  I know that the audit came out about the same time as the budget coming out, but he does he have any feelings on what we can do? Should we start by cutting it by $93 million until they can prove that they can come up with a over $186 million worth of savings and efficiencies because I'm trying to get a quarter-of-a-billion back to the trial courts, which we can do if everyone's cooperative on the judicial council and AOC side.",541,604,Discussion,Against,CA

The monies are proposed for the trial courts. I also just received word, I think last week, that the Chief Justice has started a blue-ribbon commission. My understanding is that that commission is going to really look at all aspects of the judiciary and how the business of the courts is conducted, and will be looking for efficiencies that will allow the court system to be sustainable and successful and really focus on access to justice; its main mission over the long-term.

I was very surprised to see that as a line-item issue on the budget, especially since I had a meeting with Mr. Rossi from the governor's office at the beginning of last year with Senator Torres to discuss that and, you know, as of this day I haven't heard back from anyone. I feel that that property presents are very unique economic development opportunity for the city Pomona, that region, and the state of California, but as I said to the state, I haven't heard any feedback from the administration, CSU Cal Poly, or anybody regarding the use of that. Since the latter-man property is right in my backyard in my district, I would like to see if I can get a thorough briefing on that property and where we are going with that. Also, I Want to be included, and probably along with the city of Pomona representatives, on any proposals that you're looking at doing and hear our thoughts and concerns about it as  we move forward. So, will you be willing to work with me and the city as we move forward with that?",679,747,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
12277,"Absolutely. This is a proposal in the budget. CSU has expressed interest - Cal Poly Ponoma has expressed interest in this property that is adjacent, but there are actually may other state interests in that property and CSU at this time has agreed to accommodate those, but we do agree with you that, you know, it is a critical, important area and property, and we do actually have other agencies in the state that have also some interest in co-locating some facilities given the proximity to the freeway and other things. Yes, we would be happy to continue to have discussions about how the reuse of this land can go forward.",747,803,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12301,"Okay, thank you. I also had another question regarding the apprenticeship program. You spoke real briefly on that in your opening remarks. I would like to thank the governor for adding that additional funding for the apprenticeship programs. Also, last year I did carry bill AB1797, which was requiring the workforce investment board to identify job training opportunity programs in health care related industries and fields. So, with that, I was just wondering does the governor's proposal also expand that to healthcare related programs as well?",803,836,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

Speaking of the apprenticeship programs, Madame Chair if I may, there is a nice article in today's Sac Bee regarding apprenticeship programs and it was kind of unique to have the story and we're talking about it today. I would encourage everybody if they haven't read the Sac Bee, this front page. If I can just read a quote off that, Madam Chair. It says that "a program offers a way out of poverty and trouble." I think that hits home with a lot of folks throughout the state of California.

12341,"Thank you Madame Chair. I had a question about addressing long-term liabilities. As you know, during the recession the state of California took out title 12 loans from the federal government to cover and shore up our unemployment insurance system. Those loans are supposed to be repaid within 2 years. We failed to repay those loans, and every year that goes by, every employer in the state of California consequently must pay a penalty to the federal government in recommence for the state's failure to repay those loans. This year, in 2015, the penalty for every employer in the state of California will be over $100 per employee. What I find particularly onerous about this is that this penalty has nothing to do with whether or not they've been good corporate citizens, has nothing to do with whether or not they laid off employees or laid off nobody. Every employer in our state is going to have to pay this penalty, and we are only one of 7 states in the United States that forces our employers to pay this penalty. Only 2 states pay a higher penalty rate, and this is just going to become worse and worse of a problem because the penalty goes up with every year that goes by. We're 6 years into it now. Several years from now, every employer will pay over $200 per employee. My question is why is not one of the long-term liabilities that we're choosing to address? And what's our plan for addressing it?",896,983,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
12377,"Kristin Shelton, Department of Finance. This liability, while the state has been paying the interest payment out of the general fund predominantly, is really a liability that is an employer responsibility to fund the unemployment insurance program, and to avoid not being able to pay UI benefits, the state government was able to borrow from the federal government. It's really a broader responsibility of employers.",983,1009,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12389,"Okay. So, what I heard you say was the state is paying the interest, but we're not planning to repay the principle because it's viewed as an employer responsibility.",1009,1017,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
12393,"Right. So, in lieu of repaying or coming up with a plan that would address the solvency of the unemployment insurance program, essentially the state is incurring, the employers are incurring that for the tax credit reduction each year. That partially does address the solvency. It's kind of action through some in action because it's an automatic impact to all employers.",1017,1041,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
12403,"Okay. I mean I actually dispute that characterization of it, and the reason I dispute it is because if you look at where that liability came from it came, as a result of the states and the federal government's decision to extend those unemployment benefits during the recession, and employers in our state we gave them no say in whether or not those benefits were extended. I fear that if we look in the future, I think, the projections I've seen the debt won't be paid until 2019, If you look at the penalty that all these employers are going to be paying at that point it's going to be incredibly onerous. It's just taking money out of our economy. I would really like to see us get that addressed. Thank you Madame Chair.",1041,1077,Discussion,Against_unless_amend,CA

Can you explain those costs? They keep rising how and my fellow member really grappled with this as well: how do we get a handle on those rising costs so that we can stay within the bounds, so that we can meet the needs of our under-funded courts and over challenged courts with the workload that they can't meet?",1141,1188,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

Because it seems like there seems to have been a real growth spurt in the cost during that transition.

The $250 million incentive grant proposal is a a competitive grant proposal.

The idea is that this money is really seed money, an infusion of money, to really provide an agent for change, to build a new program, to renovate or upgrade a new program, but the whole point of the local control funding formula is that there really should be, you know, a local control and local emphasis on successful programs, programs that are doing a good job of getting people the skills they need to find good jobs if that's their career path. Or the skills they need to move on to higher education.

Those are dollars that normally are planned into the budget cycle of projects that didn't get done so they fall off the radar screen. Why are we planning for that deferred maintenance to get done, so we take care of the things that we own?

I saw a figure about some affordable housing being built in San Francisco which was $500,000 per unit - the cost. So, this is obviously something that you could put a lot of money into, and you would not even really make a very large dent in the problem. It's a very big issue. Last year in our CalWORKS final budget we were able to allocate   I think around $30 million to help with critical housing and security of those individuals on the CalWORKS program, but housing and security and affordable housing are big issues that we're being faced with.

The state has provided a smaller share of bond monies for school facilities over the last decade. That has been in place. So, our proposals - we also think the current state program is very cumbersome, it's very centered in Sacramento, and it doesn't allow for the innovation and the flexibility that locals should have when they built their school facilities.",2387,2445,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

I just wanted to thank my colleagues who have uplifted and raised the issue of the need to continue to address income inequality and poverty in this year's budget, and also for specifically calling out the need for stronger early childhood education programs. I look forward to that discussion as we move forward. I did have a specific discussion or question on retiree health care costs. I know that was highlighted in the governor's proposed budget, but I also understand that the projections do not include funding for the employers component going forward. The question would be why didn't it? And maybe that's because they'll be some contract negotiations that will determine amounts. Secondly, what does the administration think about using Prop 2 funding to help support the employer's contribution as part of a shared responsibility approach?",2576,2623,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA

We do have four of our state employee contracts up early this next year, and we would anticipate having the conversation about pre funding at about a state share, an employee share, which we would envision a 50/50 sharing relationship of that pre-funding obligation. You know, we don't have it built into the budget, but that's where we would have the conversation. In terms of proposition 2, absolutely the retiree health care is an eligible debt and liability that is exactly the kind of thing that we would want to see be addressed with that required debt repayment.",2623,2674,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA

So, we've had a lot of discussion today about the debts we have, the liabilities we have, my colleague Mr. Obernolte, made  a very good point about the unemployment insurance loan that we really need to pay back that's costing us a lot of money and I agree with him. We also have the retiree health benefits that we have to address. In the governor's budget proposal he recommends - he envisions - $3.4 billion in reserves. Given the fact that California is I think the 5th most volatile state with respect to the revenue, tell me what you envision an adequate level of reserves would be for a state of this size and a state has this much volatility in its revenue.",2683,2731,Discussion,Indeterminate,CA
13123,"I think longer term the proposition 2 designated a 10% maximum reserve for the BSA. I think that was very appropriate as sort of a minimum. In fact, I think if you took out the states that are very heavily oil dependent, like Texas or Alaska, North Dakota, I imagine we're probably the most volatile for our basic revenue structure. So, you need to think in terms of having a large reserve. I appreciate that as you've been building you have other needs trying to balance. In November, our report based on our estimates, we had a $4.2 billion reserve. Again, it just flows from the different way that we do the capital gains. I thought that would be a great starting point as I said earlier, but three four is not bad. I appreciate the different pressures that you have on you from various groups. I would hope that would be sort of a floor and that you would hope that maybe you could build on that because again a downturn is coming in the near future. We don't think it's next year. California is growing well, but things can happen and the more that you have the reserve, the less disruptive is to you in making these sort of terrible short-term budget adjustments.  you in making these sort of terrible short-term budget adjustments. thank you I want to think this",2731,2801,Testimony,Indeterminate,CA
